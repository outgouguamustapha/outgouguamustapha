## 👨‍💻 About me :

**Passionate about technology and business** <img decoding="async" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/WUlplcMpOCEmTGBtBW/giphy.gif" width="30">

👋 Hi! I’m Mustapha — a data analyst with a Master’s in Financial Management.  Passionate about transforming complex data  into actionable insights that drive smarter decisions and boost business performance.

By combining my financial background with skills in SQL, Python, R, Power BI, and Google Sheets, I bridge the gap between finance and analytics—transforming raw data into meaningful insights that support strategic decision-making.

Curious by nature, I’m always asking “why” to uncover the story behind the numbers. My analytical mindset and attention to detail allow me to approach challenges from multiple perspectives and deliver meaningful solutions.

I believe strongly in continuous learning, which is why I’m currently expanding my expertise in Big Data, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence. This focus helps me understand the full data lifecycle—from storage and processing to analysis and insights—enabling me to support data-driven strategies at every stage.

I’m eager to join a dynamic team where I can continue to learn, grow, and contribute with curiosity, dedication, and an analytical approach. If you’re looking for someone motivated, detail-oriented, and committed to creating value through data, I’d be happy to connect.
